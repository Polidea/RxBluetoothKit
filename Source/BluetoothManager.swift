/**
 BluetoothManager is a class implementing ReactiveX API which wraps all Core Bluetooth Manager's functions allowing to
 discover, connect to remote peripheral devices and more. It's using thin layer behind `RxCentralManagerType` protocol which is
 implemented by `RxCBCentralManager` and should not be used directly by the user of a RxBluetoothKit library.

 You can start using this class by discovering available services of nearby peripherals. Before calling any
 public `BluetoothManager`'s functions you should make sure that Bluetooth is turned on and powered on. It can be done
 by calling and observing returned value of `monitorState()` and then chaining it with `scanForPeripherals(_:options:)`:

 bluetoothManager.rx_state
 .filter { $0 == .PoweredOn }
 .take(1)
 .flatMap { manager.scanForPeripherals(nil) }

 As a result you will receive `ScannedPeripheral` which contains `Peripheral` object, `AdvertisementData` and
 peripheral's RSSI registered during discovery. You can then `connectToPeripheral(_:options:)` and do other operations.

 - seealso: `Peripheral`

    // MARK: Scanning

    /**
     Scans for `Peripheral`s after subscription to returned observable. First parameter `serviceUUIDs` is
     an array of `Service` UUIDs which needs to be implemented by a peripheral to be discovered. If user don't want to
     filter any peripherals, `nil` can be used instead. Additionally dictionary of
     [`CBCentralManager` specific options](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreBluetooth/Reference/CBCentralManager_Class/#//apple_ref/doc/constant_group/Peripheral_Scanning_Options)
     can be passed to allow further customisation.

     Scans by default are infinite streams of `ScannedPeripheral` structures which need to be stopped by the user. For
     example this can be done by limiting scanning to certain number of peripherals or time:

     bluetoothManager.scanForPeripherals(withServices: nil)
        .timeout(3.0, timeoutScheduler)
        .take(2)

     If different scan is currently in progress and peripherals needed by a user can be discovered by it, new scan is
     shared. Otherwise scan is queued on thread specified in `init(centralManager:queueScheduler:)` and will be executed
     when other scans finished with complete/error event or were unsubscribed.

     As a result you will receive `ScannedPeripheral` which contains `Peripheral` object, `AdvertisementData` and
     peripheral's RSSI registered during discovery. You can then `connectToPeripheral(_:options:)` and do other
     operations.

     - seealso: `Peripheral`

     - parameter serviceUUIDs: Services of peripherals to search for. Nil value will accept all peripherals.
     - parameter options: Optional scanning options.
     - returns: Infinite stream of scanned peripherals.
